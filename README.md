- This is a personal website meant as a portfolio/project.
- Content will be added throughout the year.
- Many commits will occur as I learn to refine my hard HTML/CSS skills as this is a static page.
- Redesigns of the websites will happen as I try to find what looks best to me and what will display the skills/interests the best.
